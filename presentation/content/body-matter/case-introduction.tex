                In the first quarter of 2020, 
                the creditworthiness of many large financial institutions deteriorated,
                as it was unclear which companies would make it through the coronavirus crisis. 
                In addition, central banks responded to the crisis by cutting rates. 
                This is the "rates and funding double whammy".

                Let us focus specifically on JP Morgan, 
                who suffered the largest losses of these three US banks.
                JP Morgan reported a \$951m loss in CVA/FVA adjustments,
                which likely can be attributed to funding costs according to the quote
                from their earnings press release.

                (The other two banks are Bank of America and Goldman Sachs)

            As evident from the adjustment history, the adjustment in 1Q20 is quite significant.
            Since JP Morgan are rather secretive, 
            we cannot provide a breakdown of the loss,
            so the results presented here are necessarily speculative.
            But due to JP Morgan's quote, we can be fairly sure 
            that there is quite a bit of FVA in the loss. 
            Risk.net has a hypothesis on a major contributor to this loss.
            We can explain that hypothesis and it aligns nicely with our results.

            Reasons for the other large losses:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item 4Q14: CVA losses as well as refinements to FVA/DVA valuation.
                \item 2Q20: Funding spread tightening on derivatives.
                \item 1Q22: Funding spread widening and CVA due to markdowns of 
                receivables from Russia-associated counterparties.
