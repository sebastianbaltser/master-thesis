            Risk.net speculates that a contributing factor to the loss 
            may have been uncollateralised swap agreements.
        }
        \note<1>[item]{
            We explained in the paper how asymmetrical collateral agreements 
            can be a source of funding costs,
            and the corresponding graphic can explain the hypothesis of Risk.net.
        }
        \note<1>[item]{
            Not all corporate clients has the ability 
            to offer the large amount of collateral that banks need,
            and therefore the trades with those clients would be uncollateralised.
            Since corporate clients are mostly hedging loan exposures,
            banks are often biased towards having more uncollateralised pay-floating trades.
            These swaps are hedged with other financial institutions, 
            who require collateralisation.
        }
        \note<1>[item]{
            Central banks decreasing rates will decrease the value of floating legs. 
            This increases the value of JP Morgan's trade with its corporate clients.
            It decreases the mark-to-market of the hedges however;
            therefore, JP Morgan will receive calls for collateral.
            If the portfolio had a somewhat equal amount of payer- and receiver-swaps,
            the effect would be close to zero.
        }
        \note<2>[item]{
            Since creditworthiness is decreasing, 
            JP Morgan will have to fund itself at increasing rates.
            Evidently, having these uncollateralised pay-floating swaps,
            is a source of WWR as the mark-to-market of the hedges is negatively correlated
            with the funding rate. 
            The opposite of that is shown in our swap example, 
            where our imaginary firm had a low funding spread 
            from period 0 to 1, 
            such that funding were cheap during this period. 
        }
        \note<2>[item]{
            This shows a very common way of funding costs appearing in derivatives portfolios.
            Another source that we covered thoroughly could appear
            if for example the payment dates of the hedging swap differed from the actual swap,
            such that the cash flows from market movements were unaligned.
