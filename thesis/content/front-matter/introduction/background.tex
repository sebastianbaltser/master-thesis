    \subsection{Background}
        
    Prior to the financial crisis banks could obtain funding from the interbank market
    at very low lending rates, as they were considered very close to risk-free.
    With the default of large financial institutions like Lehmann Brothers, 
    it became clear that the usual assumptions of risk-free counterparties 
    in derivatives valuations did not hold.
    Interbank lending would have to account for the default risk of the counterparty,
    which entailed an increase in the borrowing rates 
    and therefore also an increase in the funding costs of banks.
    As borrowing rates were low before the financial crisis, 
    the funding costs were of negligible size 
    and they were largely ignored in the derivative pricing process.
    Soon after the crisis it became apparent that funding costs had to be considered,
    much like a institutions would consider their counterparty's default risk by 
    credit value adjustments.

    Valuation adjustments that accounts for the funding implications 
    have been aptly named \textit{Funding Value Adjustments}.
    This type of adjustments have been a source of great controversy in the financial field,
    as theoreticians strongly oppose it while practitioners deems it crucial for their operations.
    The most intense part of debate was sparked by \textcite{HullWhite2012FVA}
    when they answered the question "Is FVA a cost for derivatives desks?" 
    with a unmistakably "no".
    The difference between a "yes" and a "no" could translate to a difference 
    in the proximity of hundreds of millions of dollars for the largest financial institutions.
    As practitioners turned out to very much disagree with the conclusions of Hull \& White,
    the rejection of \FVA/ as a valid adjustment lured out a vast amount of counterarguments.

    However the debate about \FVA/ ended, banks started universally accepting the inclusion of \FVA/
    in their derivatives pricing.
    To get a glimpse of the magnitude; when JP Morgan Chase first implemented an \FVA/ framework
    for its over-the-counter derivatives it recorded a whopping 1.5 billion dollar loss
    for a one-time adjustment to its portfolio \textcite{JPMorganEarnings}.
    Since, the debate has been less focused on the appropriateness of \FVA/s
    and more focused on the way it should be accounted for.
