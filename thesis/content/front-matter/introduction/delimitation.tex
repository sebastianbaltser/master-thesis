    \section{Delimitation}

    To model market movements the thesis will use a discrete time approach 
    with discrete random variables to model prices and payoffs.
    An approach that would be more in line with reality would be to use stochastic processes,
    but, in favour of simplicity, the discrete framework is chosen 
    since it conveys the basic ideas of funding value adjustments better.

    For this reason, it must be acknowledged that the thesis will not be able to
    present a full-fledged framework for use in financial institutions,
    but rather a simple model that conceptually defines and explains funding costs 
    and their related funding value adjustments.
