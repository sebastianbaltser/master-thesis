    \subsection{Outline}

    \Cref{sec:credit-risk-theory}, \nameref{sec:credit-risk-theory}, 
    will introduce the necessary theory for the subsequent studies.
    In order to answer the first two research questions,
    \Cref{sec:the-fva-debate}, \nameref{sec:the-fva-debate}, 
    will cover \FVA/ without mathematical details, but by verbal discussion of the topics.
    The section will draw on a great amount of examples to be able to understand the matter, 
    at least in a conceptual way.
    This includes describing how funding costs in derivatives come about 
    and what the possible sources are.
    Following this, the debate on \FVA/ will be summarized
    by presenting arguments from opposing sides.

    Having an understanding of \FVA/ on a conceptual level,
    the real world examples will be simplified with mathematical frameworks.
    These frameworks will provide a mean through which the workings of \FVA/ can be studied.
    \Cref{sec:single-period-model} presents a single-period model,
    which is extended by \Cref{sec:fva-multi-period-model} to a multi-period model.
    Examples and analyses using these mathematical frameworks
    will answer the third and last research question.
