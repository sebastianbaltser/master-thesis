    \subsection{Marginal valuation of corporate assets and liabilities}
        Consider a firm whose assets and liabilities have payoff at time 1 denoted with the random variables $A$ and $L$ respectively.
        The firm defaults at event $\mathcal{D}=\{A<L\}$, i.e. when the firm no longer have enough assets to cover the liabilities, including the firm's debt, at which distress costs may occur.
        The distress costs refer to the excess expenses from the usual business costs, that the firm faces when it's unable to meet its financial obligations.
        The net asset value of the firm after defaulting, with the distress costs comprised, is $\kappa A$.
