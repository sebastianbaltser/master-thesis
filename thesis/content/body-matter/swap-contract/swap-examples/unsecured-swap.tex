    \subsection{Example of unsecured swap}
        Suppose the dealer enters a swap contract with the credit risk-free counterparty.
        She pays a constant fixed leg $K=\num{1}$ to the counterparty at each time period.
        Correspondingly, at each time period,
        the dealer receives a random floating leg, $X_t$, from the counterparty.

        Since the counterparty is credit-risk free,
        the dealer can always expect to receive the full contractual amount of the floating leg.
        Therefore, there is no \CVA/ and
        the difference between the risk-free value and the credit risk adjusted price is the \DVA/.

        The floating legs are considered random.
        Their distribution will not be specified,
        but the expected cash flows are known
        by both the dealer and the counterparty.
        If the dealer's swap leg has a higher value than the counterparty's,
        she will have to pay an upfront price to the counterparty,
        and vice versa.

        The time 0 expected payments of the swap are summarized in \cref{tbl:swap-legs}.
        Notice, that at the interim date the dealer expects a positive cash flow of
        $\mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\mathcal{C}_1\right] = \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[X_1 - K\right] = \num{0.2}$,
        which will be used for retiring existing debt.
        The expected cash flow at time 2 does not change over time.

        At the maturity date the dealer liquidates all of her assets,
        which she uses to pay the remaining outstanding amounts.
        Additionally, the existing creditors' liabilities are assumed to rank pari passu with the counterparty's contingent liabilities.
        \\
        Since the expected discounted market value of the floating payments is largest,
        the dealer may be obliged to pay the counterparty an upfront price.
        As per the Modigliani-Miller proposition, 
        a zero net present value investment leaves the aggregate wealth unchanged.
        For this to be applicable, the price of the swap must also account for the dealer's own default risk,
        i.e. include the aforementioned \DVA/.
        Otherwise, it cannot be a zero net present value investment for both the dealer and the counterparty.

        When defaulting at time 2, i.e. in state $\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}$,
        the dealer's total liabilities are calculated as:
        \begin{align*}
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                (1-\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}))\left(
                    L_{2} - 
                    \mathcal{C}_{1}R_{1}
                    - \mathcal{C}_2
                \right)
            \right]
            &=
            (1-\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}))\left(\num{70} - \num{0.2}R_{1} + \num{0.05}\right)\\
            &=
            (1-\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}))\num{69.8452}
        \end{align*}
        And by definition, this amount is equal to the total remaining asset value.
        Remember that at time 2 the dealer has already paid the liabilities due at the interim date.
        To find the price of the project
        as well as the loss rate given default after obtaining the project,
        the following system of equations must be solved for $u$ and $\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}})$:
        \begin{align}
            &\left\{\begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
                \mathscr{d}^{2}A_{0} - W
                =

                    (1-\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}))\left(L_{2} - 
                    \mathcal{C}_{1}R_{1}
                    - \mathcal{C}_2\right)
                \right]
                \\
                u =
                \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    \delta_{1}(X_1-K)+(\delta_{2}(X_2-K(1-\phi)))
                \right]
            \end{array}\right.

                =
                (1-\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}))\num{69.8452}
                \\
                \displaystyle

                \delta_2

                    \left(\num{-0.05}(1-\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}))\right)p_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}}-\num{0.05}(1-\mathscr{d})
                \right)
            \end{array}\right.
            \nonumber
        \end{align}
        The first equation in \cref{eqn:swap-example-equation-system} assures that the creditors receive the entire asset base if the firm defaults.
        The second equation sets the price of the swap as the discounted expected payoff.
        Solving this equation system yields a swap price of $u=\num{0.158655}$,
        and a loss rate in the default state of 
        $\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}})=\pct{0.112180}$.
        Using the loss rate, the value of the legacy creditors' long term claim can be calculated.
        At time 2 the payoff in the default state is 
        $L_{2}*(1-\phi(\omega_{\mathscr{d},\mathscr{d}})) = \num{62.14739601}$.
        At time 1 the expected value of the claim is therefore \num{67.61315718},
        and at time 0 the value is \num{66.287413}.

        The credit spread in each period is the debt's no-default value one period ahead
        divided by its current value less the risk-free rate.
        Hence the post-project actual credit spreads for time 0 and time 1 is:
        \begin{align}
            S_{0} 
            &=
            \frac{
                \num{67.61791744}
            }{
                \num{66.29207592}
            }
            -
            R_{0}
            =
            \pct{0}
            \\
            S_{1} 
            &= 
            \frac{
                \num{70}
            }{
                \num{67.61791744}
            } 
            -
            R_{1}
            =
            \pct{0.0112246}
        \end{align}
        Since the dealer cannot default at time 1,
        the upfront price can be funded with short-term debt at the risk-free interest rate.
        If the firm were to pay a spread on the short-term debt starting at time 0,
        this would be subtracted from the liquidated asset value. 

        By using the marginal market valuation of the swap contract
        defined in \cref{eqn:swap-value-multi-period},
        the \DVA/ can then be computed as:
        \begin{align}
            \DVA/ &= u - V_{rf}
            \nonumber
            \\
            &= u - \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\sum_{t=1}^{2}\delta_t \mathcal{C}_t\right]
            = \num{0.0104476}
        \end{align}

        Turning to the shareholder valuation of the project.
        Cash flows from the swap contract may have an impact on the shareholders' valuation of the project.
        Since the swap's price is its risk-neutral value adjusted for credit risk,
        the project is a zero net present value investment for the counterparty.
        If a wealth transfer has happened, it is bound to be between the shareholders and the long-term creditors.

        The swap provides an overall funding benefit for the dealer,
        and increases the value of the shareholders' claim.
        Since the dealer cannot default at the interim date,
        there are no funding costs from obtaining short-term debt at time 0.
        At time 1, the dealer expects a swap payment from the counterparty,
        and this cash flow is passed on to the creditors, reducing the long-term debt.
        Hence, the shareholders do not have to pay interest on this retired debt,
        and their payoff increases.

        With $\mathbb{E}_{t}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\mathcal{C}_1\right]=\num{0.2}$,
        $\mathbb{E}_{t}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\mathcal{C}_2\right]=\num{-0.05}$,
        $u=\num{0.158655}$,
        and the assumption that the counterparty is credit risk-free,
        the total impact on the shareholders' benefit is calculated using \cref{eqn:shareholders-value-multi-period-swap}:
        \begin{equation}
            G_{swap} = \num{-0.00906097}
        \end{equation}
        This value suggests a wealth transfer of $\num{-0.00906097}$
        between the shareholders and the creditors of the long-term debt,
        such that the project is a negative net present value investment for the creditors.

        The price that would make this project a zero net present value investment for the shareholders,
        is found by fixing $G_{swap}$ to 0,
        and solving for $u^{\ast}$.
        The difference between the credit risk adjusted price and $u^{\ast}$ is then the \FVA/:
        \begin{equation}
            G_{swap} = 0
        \end{equation}
        yielding a funding adjusted price of $u^{\ast} = \num{0.148727}$.
        The donation from the counterparty required is then:
        \begin{equation}
            \FVA/ = u^{\ast} - u = \num{-0.00992852}
        \end{equation}

        This example has shown a situation where some of the derivatives cash flows have
        been a source of funding benefits,
        but where the overall effect were still a loss to the shareholders.
        The primary effect is clearly from the upfront price,
        that is the largest outgoing cash flow of the swap.
        Still, there are smaller effects which are interesting to study.

        The payment time of a cash flow has an influence on its funding implications.
        As the upfront price should be paid at time 0, 
        the firm can obtain funding in the first period at a very low credit spread of \pct{0}.
        However, the intermediate incoming cash flow can retire debt
        that would otherwise have appreciated 
        by the dealer's credit spread at time 1 of \pct{0.011298}.
        Therefore, the time 1 cash flow provides a funding benefit,
        but the time 0 cash flow has no funding cost.
        Of course, the setup considered here is incredible simplistic,
        which exaggerates the actual effects.
        In reality, creditors would clearly not offer a credit spread of zero on, say,
        1 month tenors because they feel certain that the firm can only default in 2 months.

        Still, the general lesson is useful anyway.
        If institutions have high credit spreads in certain periods,
        it will be more costly for them to obtain projects 
        that have outgoing cash flows in these periods.
        This is the case at play in the example.
        The firm has a large face value maturing at time 2, 
        so its default probability, and therefore credit spread,
        is high around this time period.
        Hence funding requirements at time 1 have a high impact.

        As has been covered previously, trading unsecured derivatives without hedging market risk
        has the most extreme funding implications;
        any outgoing cash flow has to be funded, 
        as there are no offsetting cash flows from hedges.

        If the dealer was extend the project by entering a fully collateralized hedged position,
        the funding implication would mainly be due to the margin requirements.
        The cash flows stemming from the original swap would directly offset the cash flows from the hedged swap.
        As opposed to the first swap,
        the valuation of the hedged swap will not include any \DVA/,
        as the counterparty of this contract will not be exposed to the dealer's credit risk.
        This will cause a mismatch between the two swap prices,
        and funding is required.
        While the posted collateral would be funded by short-term debt issuance,
        the received collateral would retire some existing short-term debt.
        As defined previously in this paper,
        retiring debt will lead to the shareholders paying a smaller spread,
        such that their welfare can have both positive and negative outcomes.
