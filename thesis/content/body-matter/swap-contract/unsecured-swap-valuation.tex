    \subsection{Valuing unsecured swaps}
        In this section the client swap is assumed to be fully unsecured.
        In other words, no collateral is exchanged between the dealer and the swap client, 
        neither at the transaction date nor the interim date.
        For simplicity and for the purpose of marginal valuation,
        if a swap party defaults at the interim date, the coupon payments will have been paid immediately prior.
        This assumption allows the contingent liabilities from the swap to be paid along with the rest of the liabilities at the given time of default.
        And, as all liabilities rank pari passu, the computational part becomes more interpretive.

        The swap counterparty's time of default is denoted by $\tau_{C}$.
        At this point in time, the dealer recovers a fraction of the contractual amount denoted by $\beta_{t}$, where $\beta_{t} = 1$ if $\tau_{C}>t$.
        \\
        \textcolor{red}{Initially, it is also assumed that there are no legacy positions between the dealer and the swap client.
        This assumption will be relaxed in SECTION ???, where the effect of netting the swap cash flows against those of the legacy positions with the same client is analysed.}

        Regardless of the method of funding, the apparent marginal market value of the swap is defined by:
        \begin{align}
            V &=
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \delta_2 \left(\mathcal{C}_{1} R_{1} + \mathcal{C}_{2}\right)
                - u
            \right]
            \nonumber
            \\
            &\quad +
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \sum_{t=1}^{2} \delta_{t} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F} = t\}}\mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}>t-1\}} \phi_t Y_{t}^{-} 
            \right]
            \nonumber
            \\
            &\quad -
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \sum_{t=1}^{2} \delta_{t} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C} = t\}}\mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>t-1\}} (1-\beta_t) Y_{t}^{+} 
            \right]
            \label{eqn:swap-value-multi-period}
        \end{align}
        where $Y_{1} = \mathbb{E}_{1}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\mathcal{C}_{2}\right]/R_{2}$ and $Y_{2} = \mathcal{C}_{2}$.

        The swap value takes into account the credit risks of both the firm and the counterparty.
        Therefore, two adjustments are performed on the the credit risk-free value, $V_0$.
        From the dealer's point of view,
        the \DVA/ is the second term in \cref{eqn:swap-value-multi-period} adding to the credit risk-free swap value,
        whereas the \CVA/ is the third term subtracting from the value.
        As a result of that, the total swap value for the swap client is $-V$.

        In the multi-period framework, it is assumed that the dealer always use debt funding for financing financial instruments.
        Many established companies have a high credit score,
        hence they have no issues obtaining debt and become leveraged.
        It is not unusual for large firms to have multiple creditors.
        This common use of taking on loans constitutes the decision of the above assumption.
        By financing the upfront with new short-term debt, the marginal valuation of the dealer's shareholders of entering the swap contract is now analysed.
        The net positive cash flows stemming from the swap are perceived as funding benefits as they will be used to retire some of the dealer's short-term debt.
        
        As defined in \cref{sec:marginal-valuation-debt-issuance} about marginal shareholder valuation using debt funding,
        the face value of the new debt is the upfront including a spread, such that the loan is a zero net present value investment for the new creditors.
        Similar to the single-period model, the firm is interested in not decreasing its shareholders' value.
        With the face value of the new debt now defined as $D_{2}(q) = U(q)(R_{0} + s_{0}(q))(R_{1} + s_{1}(q))$,
        the marginal increase in the value of the firm's equity per unit investment is:
        \begin{align}
            G_{\text{debt}} &=
            \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial q}
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \delta_{2} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)>1\}}
                \left(
                    A - W
                    + q\left(\mathcal{C}_{1} R_{1} + \mathcal{C}_{2}\right)
                    - L_{2}
                    - D_{2}(q)
                \right)
            \right]\right\rvert_{q=0}
            \nonumber
            \\
            &\quad+
            \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial q}
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \delta_2 \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)>1\}}
                \left(q\mathcal{C}_{1} s_1(q) + \theta_{1}R_{1}\right)
            \right]\right\rvert_{q=0}
            \nonumber
            \\
            &\quad-
            \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial q}
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}}
                \left(
                    \sum_{t=1}^{2} \delta_{t} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)=t\}}q\left(1-\beta_t\right)Y_{t}^{+}
                \right)
            \right]\right\rvert_{q=0}
        \end{align}
        The first term describes the residual of the total asset value at time 2 if the firm does not default in either of the time periods, and the counterparty does not default at time 1.
        The residual of the total asset value is the asset value including the swap cash flow less the value of the debt paid at time 1 and the debt to pay at time 2.
        \\
        At the interim date the firm is obliged to either pay of receive the contractual coupon payment.
        If the cash flow is negative for the firm, a new debt is assumed to finance the payment,
        and if the cash flow is positive for the firm, a portion of the firm's existing debt is assumed to be retired.
        The second term expresses the spread of having debt from time 1 until time of maturity scaled by the amount that is either retiring or funding debt at the interim date.
        Evidently, if the cash flow at time 1 is positive, the term has a positive impact of the shareholders' value,
        and if the cash flow at time 1 is negative, the term has a negative impact of the shareholders' value.
        Furthermore, the second term includes the random dividend that the shareholders receive at the interim date.
        \\
        The third term reflects the cases of the counterparty defaulting.
        The contractual outstanding amount, i.e. the potential positive cash flow at time 2, will not be fully paid to the firm.
        The fraction of the amount recovered is indicated by $\beta_{t}$.
        \\
        By expressing this derivative as a difference quotient, using $U(0)=0$,
        and by the linearity of the expectation operator,
        the following limit is obtained:
        \begin{align*}
            &=
            \lim_{q \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{
                \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    \delta_{2} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)>1\}}
                    \left(
                        q\left(\mathcal{C}_{1} R_{1} + \mathcal{C}_{2}\right)
                        - D_{2}(q)
                    \right)
                \right]
            }{
                q
            }
            \\
            &\quad+
            \lim_{q \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{
                \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    \delta_2 \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)>1\}}
                    q\mathcal{C}_{1} s_1(q)
                \right]
            }{
                q
            }
            \\
            &\quad-
            \lim_{q \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{
                \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}}
                    \left(
                        \sum_{t=1}^{2} \delta_{t} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)=t\}}q\left(1-\beta_t\right)Y_{t}^{+}
                    \right)
                \right]
            }{
                q
            }
            \\
            &\quad-
            \lim_{q \rightarrow 0}
            \frac{
                \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    \delta_{2} \left(
                    \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)>1\}} - \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}>1\}}\right)
                    \left(
                        A - W
                        - L_{2}
                        + \theta_{1}R_{1}
                    \right)
                \right]
            }{
                q
            }
        \end{align*}
        It is assumed that $A$, $W$, $L_{2}$, $\mathcal{C}_1$, $\mathcal{C}_2$, and $\theta_1$ all have finite expectations,
        which allows for interchanging the limit and the expectation.
        $\mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}(q)>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}(q)>1\}} - \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}>1\}}$ equals 0 in the limit,
        which entails that the fourth terms equals 0.
        \\
        Expanding the limiting face value, $D_{2}$, yields:
        \begin{equation}
            D_2 = u(R_0 + S_0)(R_1 + S_1) = u R_0 R_1 + u R_0 S_1 + u R_1 S_0 + u S_0 S_1
        \end{equation}
        Focussing on the addend $u S_0 S_1$, remember that the value of each credit spread depends on the loss rate from the respective time period.
        From the expressions of the credit spreads, it is noticed that the expectation of the loss rates from the different time periods are multiplied.
        Using the linearity of expectations and the tower property, the following derivation can then be used:
        \begin{equation*}
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\phi_1\right]
            * \mathbb{E}_{1}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\phi_2\right]
            = \mathbb{E}_{1}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \phi_2 \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\phi_1\right]
            \right] 
            = \mathbb{E}_{1}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    \phi_2
                    \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                        \phi_1
                    \right]
                \right]
            \right]
            = \mathbb{E}_{1}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    \phi_2 \phi_1
                \right]
            \right]
            = 0
        \end{equation*}
        and, since the loss rate must be zero in at least one of the two periods,
        $\mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\delta_2\mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>2,\tau_{C}>1\}}u S_0 S_1\right] = 0$.
        
        By dividing $q$ into the expectation of the first limit in the above equation, it can be recognized that $U(q)/q$ is the marginal investment cost, $u$.
        Rearranging and taking the limits yields:
        \begin{align}
            G_{\text{debt}} &= 
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>2\}}
                \left(
                    \delta_{2} \left(\mathcal{C}_{1} R_{1} + \mathcal{C}_{2}\right) - u
                \right)
            \right]
            \nonumber
            \\
            &\quad-
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>2\}}
                \left(
                    \sum_{t=1}^{2} \delta_{t} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}=t\}}\left(1-\beta_t\right)Y_{t}^{+}
                \right)
            \right]
            \nonumber
            \\
            &\quad-
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \delta_2 \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}>1\}} u \left(
                    R_{1} S_{0} + R_{0} S_{1}
                \right)
            \right]
            \nonumber
            \\
            &\quad+
            \mathbb{E}_{0}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                \delta_2 \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{F}>2\}} \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau_{C}>1\}}
                \mathcal{C}_{1} S_1
            \right]
        \end{align}
        where the third and the fourth terms together constitutes the second interpretation of \FVA/ according to \cref{sec:defining-fva}.
        % This result differs a tiny bit from the one ADS presents. The term: $u S_0 R_1$ is somehow within another indicator function, and I don't know how.
        They correspond to the quantity $\Phi$, which is the marginal valuation of the swap contract to the firm's legacy creditors.
        \\
        Since the cash flow at time 2 becomes 0 if the counterparty defaults at the interim date,
        and the marginal investment cost is constant regardless of the default times of either counterparties,
        the indicator of $\{\tau_{C}>1\}$ can be removed from the first term.

        To find the value of the swap contract that makes the shareholders indifferent to entering the project, $u^{\ast}$,
        the following equation must be solved for $u$:
        \begin{equation}
            0 = G_{\text{debt}}
        \end{equation}

        This valuation considers several scenarios, as different counterparties can default at different dates.
        As a consequence, both the dealer and the counterparty has a possibility to lose an otherwise promised income.
        In the next section the dealer hedges the unsecured swap with an interdealer swap that requires both initial margin and variation margin.
