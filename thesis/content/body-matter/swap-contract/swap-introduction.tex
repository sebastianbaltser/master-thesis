    Having discussed different examples from different setups,
    the framework is now extended to study a multi-period model.
    Specifically, the firm agrees on a secured swap contract with a counterparty.
    
    This section studies the impact on the firm's capital structure of such a contract.
    As discussed in \cref{sec:funding-asymmetric-collateral}, a swap contract can have different types of collateral agreements.
    The valuation framework in this section will focus solely on an unsecured swap,
    but in the subsequent illustrative example 
    the implications of including hedging and collateralization will be discussed.
    While the distinction between secured and unsecured swap valuations could be interesting to discuss,
    the primary objective of this section is to calculate swap \FVA/s, \CVA/s, and \DVA/s.

    The multi-period framework study will culminate in a numerical example.
    The purpose of that is to quantify the funding costs and -benefits,
    making it possible to visualise the exact effects on the shareholders' welfare of entering financial projects.
    \\
    First, the setup of the multi-period framework is defined.
