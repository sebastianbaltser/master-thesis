    Having discussed different examples from different setups,
    the framework is now extended to study a multi-period model.
    Specifically, the firm agrees on a secured swap contract with a counterparty.
    
    This section studies the impact on the firm's capital structure of such a contract.
    As discussed in \cref{sec:funding-asymmetric-collateral}, a swap contract can have different types of collateral agreements.
    The setup in this section will vary between perfect collateralization and partial collateralization.
    That the derivative is now marked-to-market in multiple periods causes collateral to be either posted or received as the swap contract changes in value over time.
    If, for instance, the collateral call frequency is different for the dealer's agreements with the counterparty and exchange, an asymmetry of the collateralization scheme will happen.
    While the distinction between secured and unsecured swap valuations might as well be of interest,
    the objective of this section is to calculate swap \FVA/s, \CVA/s, and \DVA/s.

    Firstly, the setup of the multi-period framework is defined.

    % Here we might want to specifically introduce the different setups we intent to analyze in this section.
