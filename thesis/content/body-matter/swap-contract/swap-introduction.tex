    Still missing at this point is to study the effects of a project
    having cash flows in-between its inception date and maturity date.
    Such cash flows could also lead to financing requirements,
    which could have implications for the project's funding costs.
    Of course, the single-period model is unable to capture this complexity.

    Therefore, this part will expand the single-period model to a multi-period model.
    The first section will provide the framework of a two-period model, 
    which can easily be extended to more periods,
    and define a firm operating in such an economy.
    Additionally, the shareholders' financing costs 
    of obtaining unsecured swap contracts will be derived.

    The derivations will ultimately be followed by a numerical example
    with the purpose of quantifying the funding costs and -benefits of obtaining a swap contract.
    This should give a general comprehension of the effect from financing a derivative's cash flows,
    which could then be carried over to more complex modelling.

    First, the setup of the multi-period framework is defined.
