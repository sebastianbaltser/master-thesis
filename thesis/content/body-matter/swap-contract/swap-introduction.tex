    Having discussed different examples from different setups,
    the framework is now extended to study a two-period model.
    Specifically, the firm agrees on a secured swap contract with a counterparty.
    \\
    This section studies the impact on the firm's capital structure of such contract.
    As discussed in \cref{sec:funding-asymmetric-collateral} a swap contract can have different types collateral agreements. The setup in this section will vary between perfect collateralization and partial collateralization. The addition of observing the derivative in multiple periods causes collateral to be either posted or received as the swap contract changes in value over time.
