    \subsection{Sources of funding costs}
        In the context of an OTC derivatives dealer,
        \cite{Ruiz2013FVA} states that funding costs can have two different sources,
        either asymmetry in collateral agreements or the payment liabilities due to the contract itself.
        Both of these sources will be discussed in the following sections.

    \subsubsection{Funding costs from asymmetrical collateral agreements}
        Like CVAs, funding costs can be viewed as a component of the cost of trading derivates
        that are not subject to a perfect CSA agreement, 
        where collateral are posted continuously with no thresholds on the margin amounts. 
        When the collateralization scheme with the derivative counterparty is imperfect, 
        the collateral postings will most likely not match the collateral postings stemming from the market risk hedges.
        This is often the case as the dealer will likely hedge market risk in an exchange requiring full collateralization.
        This source of funding cost is best observed in the most extreme case, where the dealer trades unsecured derivatives. 

        Imagine that the derivatives dealer is selling an unsecured OTC derivative to a counterparty.
        In order to avoid the market risk of the investment, 
        the dealer will perform the opposite (perhaps synthetical) trade with an exchange,
        i.e. the dealer hedges its market risk to the counterparty.
        The exchange requires full collateralization.
        Any collateral that needs to be posted to the exchange must be borrowed from the dealer's funding institution.
        The loan is unsecured why the funding institution charges a spread,
        more specifically the dealer pays the rate $\OIS/ + \text{funding spread}$.
        The collateral posted at the exchange is secured by the actual investment demanding the collateral,
        and therefore earns the \OIS/ rate.
        The difference between the interest paid on the loan and the interest earned on the collateral is the funding cost;
        suffered by the derivatives dealer for entering the trade with the counterparty. 

        The funding cost can be reduced if the dealer has in place a CSA agreement allowing rehypothication with the counterparty.
        The posting of collateral by the counterparty reduces the credit risk of the dealer,
        but the dealer still faces the market risk from the derivative so again it creates a market risk hedge at the exchange.
        Yet, since rehypothication is allowed,
        the collateral posted by the counterparty can be passed onto the exchange as collateral demanded by the hedge.
        This reduces the dealer's need for borrowing unsecured funds from the funding institution and ultimately reduces the funding costs of the dealer.
        However the funding costs are still present to the extent that the collateral agreement with the counterparty is asymmetric to that with the exchange.
        The dealer still need to borrow the difference from the funding institution.
        In case the two collateral agreements are identical the funding cost will be eliminated since the collateral received from the counterparty will completely suffice as collateral posted to the exchange.

        Funding costs, such as this, has left financial institutions justifying an adjustment to the price of the derivatives
        corresponding to the funding cost they will suffer from the trade.
        This justification is however refused by \cite{HullWhite2012FVA}.
        They state that, since a hedge consists of buying and selling assets for their market prices,
        performing a hedge is an investment with zero net present value.
        Exchanging money for assets of identical value,
        is simply moving value around and these operations should not influence valuations. 

        Nonetheless, as the previous example shows,
        trading OTC derivatives with no market for repurchase agreements will require unsecured funding,
        which will entail paying an interest rate above the \OIS/.
        Even when repo markets exists, hedging might require unsecured funding,
        which can be shown with an example by \cite{Castagna2012FVA}.
        Consider a dealer buying a european call option,
        with the intention to hedge the market risk.
        To create the replication strategy the dealer must short an amount of the underlying asset corresponding to the option Delta of the call option.
        If the underlying asset can be sold at repo the dealer will receive the repo rate.
        However to pay the premium for the call option the dealer must borrow unsecured funds from its funding institution,
        paying again the funding spread. 

        In any case,
        the funding spread could very well be part of the hedging strategy which makes it undeniable for dealers when performing valuation of the initial investments.

        Another argument proposed by \cite{HullWhite2012FVA} is the fact that dealers buys Treasury instruments and other low-yielding assets returning less than the dealers' average funding cost.
        They do this without applying an FVA and the implication of the argument is that there is an inconsistency in dealer practice,
        as the low-yielding instruments would be unprofitable if an FVA was made.
        The previous discussion however nests an explanation for this dealer behavior.
        For Treasury instruments and the like,
        very developed repo markets exists such that the purchase of these instruments can be financed with secured funding.
        Consequently the funding cost of buying these instruments is likely much lower than the dealers' average funding cost,
        which partly explain why dealers willingly buy them.
        As shown by the example of the OTC derivatives dealer the lack of a repo market for derivatives is exactly the reason why funding costs appears in the first place.
        In fact \cite[Section~9.4.1]{Green2015XVA} using the Burgard-Kjaer Semi-Replication model\footcite{BurgardKjaer2013Funding} shows that the existence of a repo market would eliminate the need for an FVA on derivatives.
