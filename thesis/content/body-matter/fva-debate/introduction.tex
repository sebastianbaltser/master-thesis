    Having established the relevant financial concepts, 
    the thesis can venture further into the topic of \FVA/s.
    This section will describe why these adjustments came about in the first place
    as well as covering some sources of funding costs; 
    the quantities that an \FVA/ tries to amount for.
    Finally, with an even better understanding of \FVA/s, 
    the controversy that has been surrounding them is summarized and analysed.
