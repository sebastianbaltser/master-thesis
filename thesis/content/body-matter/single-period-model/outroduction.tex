\begin{document}
    This section has derived the marginal shareholder valuations of obtaining a new project
    with different types of funding.
    As was concluded, if an upfront price had to be financed,
    the shareholders preferred cash funding over debt funding
    which they preferred over equity funding.
    The definition of \FVA/ ended up as being the price adjustment needed
    for the shareholders to break even on obtaining the project.
