\begin{document}
    This section has derived the marginal shareholder valuations of obtaining a new project
    with different types of funding.
    As was concluded, if an upfront price has to be financed,
    the shareholders prefer cash funding over debt funding
    which they prefer over equity funding.
    The definition of \FVA/ to be utilized in this paper ended up as being the price adjustment needed
    for the shareholders' payoff to break even on obtaining the project.
