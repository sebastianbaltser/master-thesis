    This section has derived the marginal shareholder valuations of obtaining a new project
    with different types of funding.
    As was concluded, if an upfront price has to be financed,
    the shareholders prefer cash funding over debt funding
    which they prefer over equity funding.
    for the shareholders to break even on obtaining the project.
