    \subsection{Defining FVA}
        Still remains at this point to properly define \FVA/, at least in a technical manner.
        According to \cite{ADS2019} there are multiple ways of calculating \FVA/ used in practice and theory,
        and a couple of viable definitions will be explained in this section.
