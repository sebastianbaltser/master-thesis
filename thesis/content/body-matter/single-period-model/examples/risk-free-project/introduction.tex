    This section will provide an example of funding costs in a single-period model
    using a risk-free asset as the project under the firm's consideration.
    Consider the economy defined by a single-period model with $N=5$ states, 
    and the following associated Arrow-Debreu prices:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr}
                $i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
                \hline
                $\psi_{i}$ & $0.06$ & $0.24$ & $0.29$ & $0.28$ & $0.12$ \\
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{}
            \label{tbl:example-firm-structure}
        \end{table}
    implying a discount factor of $\discountfactor = 0.99$ and a risk-free interest rate of $\rfrate = 1.0101\%$.
    A firm operates in this economy and invests in risky assets 
    which are funded by equity and debt deposits and returns payoff specified shortly.
    In the event of default, the firm is assumed to face no distress cost, i.e. $\kappa = 1$, 
    such that the bankruptcy estate is distributed entirely to the creditors.
    The firm has been funded by debt such that the face value of debt is $80$, 
    which gives rise to the following payoff structure:
    \begin{table}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr}
            $i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
            \hline
            $A(\omega_{i})$ & 120 & 110 & 100 & 95 & 60 \\
            $D(\omega_{i})$ & 80 & 80 & 80 & 80 & 60 \\
            $S(\omega_{i})$ & 40 & 30 & 20 & 15 & 0
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{}
        \label{tbl:example-pre-project-capital-structure}
    \end{table}
    The associated present values of the payoffs, $A$, $D$ and $S$, 
    are discounted expected value of the payoff with respect to the risk neutral probability measure:
        \begin{gather}
            \pi(A) = \discountfactor \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[A\right] = 96.40 \\
            \pi(D) = \discountfactor \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[D\right] = 76.80
            \qquad \pi(S) = \discountfactor \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[S\right] = 19.60
        \end{gather}
    The face value of the debt includes a credit spread that the firm must pay in order to account for its own credit risk.
    As seen in \cref{tbl:example-pre-project-capital-structure},
    the creditors do not receive their entire face value in the default event, $\omega_5$.
    The relative difference between the discounted payoff and the promised face value
    represents the credit spread of the creditors.
    If the creditors obtained the debt by paying the discounted payoff,
    the credit spread would ensure that the net present value of obtaining the debt was zero.
    In addition to calculating the shareholder's marginal valuation of a new project
    it is interesting to also evaluate the impact on the creditors valuation of their claim. 
    Therefore, it is useful to calculate the credit spread of the firm's debt 
    before entering any projects and the credit spread after entering a project.
    The same goes for the loss rate.

    The credit spread before entering any project is $80/76.80 - \grossrfrate = 3.157\%$.
    Using \cref{eqn:creditor-loss-rate}, the loss rate of the creditors in the default event is:
    $\frac{80-60}{80} = 25.0\%$
    while in all other states the loss rate is zero, as the firm does not default.

    The derivations in previous sections, 
    which described limiting spreads and marginal shareholder valuations, 
    were rooted in the assumption of the firm obtaining an infinitesimal project.
    This section will use the results in a practical application,
    where a larger that infinitesimal project will be obtained by the firm.
    All equations describing marginal shareholder valuations will still hold,
    as long as the project is not \textit{too large}.
    The project is not too large as long as its payoff and financing does not 
    alter its default probability, which, in this discrete setting, means
    that the set of default and no-default states should remain unchanged.
    
    Assume that the firm faces a new risk-free project in which it can invest
    and that the project has a promised return of $10$ at time 1.
    The project is risk-free in the sense that the payoff is known with certainty at time 0, so:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr}
                $i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
                \hline
                $Y(\omega_{i})$ & $10$ & $10$ & $10$ & $10$ & $10$
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{}
        \end{table}
    which implies a present value of $\pi(Y) = \discountfactor \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[Y\right] = 9.90$, 
    corresponding to the price of 10 zero coupon bonds, as the project is merely an investment in the risk-free asset.
    Obtaining the payoff requires an upfront cost equal to the fair value of the project, 
    i.e. the marginal investment cost is $u = \pi(Y)$.
    As discussed in previous sections the firm have different means of obtaining funding
    for paying the investment cost of the project.
    Financing through debt issuance is examined in the following section 
    and financing by share issuance in the section after that.
