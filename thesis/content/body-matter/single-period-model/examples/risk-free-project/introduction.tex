    Assume that the firm faces a new risk-free project in which it can invest,
    and that the project has a promised return of $\num{1}$ at time 1.
    The project is risk-free in the sense that the payoff is known with certainty at time 0, so:
        \begin{table}[H]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr||r}
                $i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & Present value\\
                \hline
                $Y(\omega_{i})$ & 
                    \num{1} & \num{1} & \num{1} & \num{1} & \num{1} & \num{0.99}
            \end{tabular}
            \caption{}
            \label{tbl:single-period-simple-derivative-payoff}
        \end{table}
    Obtaining the payoff requires an upfront cost equal to the fair value of the project.
    With a slightly redefined notation, since the project is not infinitesimal,
    the marginal investment cost of the project will be denoted by $u$.
    Assume that the counterparty offering the project makes a zero net present value investment, 
    such that the price of the project equals the value, i.e. $u = \pi(Y)$.
    As discussed in previous sections, the firm has different means of obtaining funding
    for paying the investment cost of the project.
    Financing through debt issuance is examined in the following section 
    and financing by share issuance in the section after that.
