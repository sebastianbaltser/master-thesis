    \subsubsection{Free Riders From Firm Frictions}
    \label{sec:example-risk-free-project-debt-issuance}
        In this section, the firm finances the new project by issuing new debt.
        In order to fund the upfront of the project, $u$, 
        the firm must issue debt to new creditors such that the price of the debt, 
        equals the price of the project.
        \\
        As assumed previously, the new debt ranks pari passu with the legacy debt, 
        such that all creditors experience the same loss rate in states where the firm defaults.
        The setup is illustrated in \cref{fig:debt-issuance-setup}.
        \\
        Denote the face value of the new debt claim by $\tilde{D}_{1}$, 
        i.e. the value of the debt at time 1 if the firm does not default. 
        A claim with face value $\tilde{D}_{1}$ which ranks pari passu to another claim 
        with face value $L$ has the random loss rate given by \cref{eqn:creditor-loss-rate}:
            \begin{align*}
                \phi
                &=
                    \frac{
                        \tilde{D}_{1} + L - (A + Y)
                    }{
                        \tilde{D}_{1} + L
                    }
                    \mathbbm{1}_{\mathcal{D}}
                \nonumber \\
                &=
                    \frac{
                        \tilde{D}_{1} + \num{80} - (A + Y)
                    }{
                        \tilde{D}_{1} + \num{80}
                    }
                    \mathbbm{1}_{\{A + Y < \tilde{D}_{1} + \num{80}\}} 
            \end{align*}
        The random payoff of the new pari passu debt is denoted by $\tilde{D}$ and given as:
            \begin{align*}
                \tilde{D}
                    = (1 - \phi)\tilde{D}_{1}
            \end{align*}
        In order for the firm to attract new creditors,
        they must offer a large enough face value on the debt, 
        such that buying the debt is a zero net present value investment.
        The new debt should be able to cover the investment cost of the new project;
        hence, the present value of the new debt must equal $u$.
        Therefore, the face value must be chosen to solve the following equation:
            \begin{align*}
                u &= \pi(\tilde{D}) \\
                \Leftrightarrow  \qquad
                \num{0.99} 
                &= 
                    \discountfactor
                    \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                        1 - \phi
                    \right] 
                    \tilde{D}_{1}
            \end{align*}
        While seemingly simple, this equation proves rather difficult to solve analytically for $\tilde{D}_{1}$.
        By substituting the loss rate, it is clear that the face value is quite entangled in the equation;
        both in the default event and in the fraction:
            \begin{align*}
                \num{0.99}
                &= 
                \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[
                    1 
                    - 
                    \frac{
                        \num{80} + \tilde{D}_{1} - A + Y
                    }{
                        \num{80} + \tilde{D}_{1}
                    }
                    \mathbbm{1}_{\{A + Y < \num{80} + \tilde{D}_{1}\}} 
                \right] 
                \tilde{D}_{1} 
            \end{align*}
        However, by studying this expanded equation, it is clear that the right hand side 
        is increasing in $\tilde{D}_{1}$, as that holds true for all the terms that constitute it.
        Hence, the equation $u = \pi(\tilde{D})$ is very much suited for any simple numerical optimisation procedure
        for root finding, as long as the evaluation of the function itself is not too computationally heavy.
        In a single-period framework, especially one with as few states as the current,
        the evaluation of the expectation is by no means problematic.
        Since it is effective and simple, the equation will be solved by numerical procedures, 
        which yields the following solution:
            \begin{align*}
                \Leftrightarrow  \qquad
                \tilde{D}_{1} &= \num{1.030889}
            \end{align*}
        Entering into the project and issuing new debt with face value $\num{1.030889}$ 
        alters the payoffs associated with the firm described in \cref{tbl:debt-issuance-payoffs}.

        The new project has therefore resulted in an expected default loss to creditors of 
        $\mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[\phi\right] = \pct{0.029964}$,
        and a new credit spread on debt of:
        \begin{equation*}
            \frac{
                1.030889
            }{    
                0.99
            } 
            -
            R
            = 
            \frac{
                76.826874
            }{    
                80
            } 
            -
            R
            =
            \pct{0.031201}
        \end{equation*}
        The example will continue with this credit spread, instead of the limiting spread,
        to calculate the correct funding costs.
        \\
        Recall that the limiting spread, i.e. the estimation of the post-project credit spread, 
        was calculated as $S = \pct{0.031566}$.
        Since the limiting spread is an overestimation of the actual credit spread,
        the funding costs will be overestimated as well.
        The overestimation is due to the project's risk compared to the firm's assets;
        since the project is risk-free, it reduces the overall riskiness of the firm
        as well as the loss rate and the credit spread.
        Thus, the examples use the actual credit spread instead of the estimation, 
        such that the focus can remain on the funding implications
        without the uncertainty of estimations.

        Investing in the project increases the present value of the firm's assets by $\num{97.39} - \num{96.40} = \num{0.99}$, 
        which, not surprisingly, is the value of the project.
        More interesting is the impact on the shareholders' claim that decreases by an amount $\num{19.573126} - \num{19.6} = \num{-0.026874}$; 
        therefore, investing in the project is of negative value to the shareholders.
        If the firm defaults, the shareholders still receive nothing, 
        but in all other states where the firm does not default, 
        the shareholders pay the interest owed to the new creditors 
        due to the credit risk in the firm.
        The legacy creditors observe their debt claim with face value $\num{80}$ increase by an amount
        $\num{76.826874} - \num{76.80} = \num{0.026874}$.

        Evidently, while the project is a negative net present value investment for the shareholders,
        the investment is a positive net present value investment for the legacy creditors.
        When the firm does not default, the creditors still receive their promised payoff 
        corresponding to the face value of their debt.
        However, the new project has increased the asset base of the firm; if the firm defaults, 
        the legacy creditors will share part of the payoff from the project with the new creditors.
        Hence, the legacy creditors are receiving a larger amount at the default compared to the pre-project amount, and their claim increases in value.
        Their increasing wealth also suggests that the conditions have improved in terms of their exposure to the firm's credit risk.
        This is also justified, as the loss rate given default has decreased from the pre-project value of \pct{0.25}.
        Correspondingly, the new credit spread is lower than the pre-project credit spread.

        The Modigliani-Miller invariance proposition assures that making a zero net present value investment 
        does not increase the value of the firm.
        That is to say that obtaining the new project should neither create nor destroy value in aggregate terms,
        which explains why the amount lost by shareholders is the amount gained by legacy creditors.
        The asset base also increases by the value of the project, 
        but decreases by the value of the debt claim used to finance it; 
        both are priced the same and therefore offset each other.
        \\
        In this example, the wealth lost by the shareholders is entirely transferred to the legacy creditors,
        since the project is a zero net present value both to the new creditors 
        and to the counterparty offering the project.
        Had the project been a negative net present value investment for the counterparty, 
        or perhaps the new creditors, the shareholders would benefit from a share of this discount,
        and the value gained by legacy creditors would not be entirely from the shareholders.

        The wealth transfer from shareholders to legacy creditors due to the new project 
        suggests quantifying the \FVA/ of the project.
        Using \cref{eqn:shareholders-breakeven-debt-financing}, the price needed for breakeven is:
            \begin{align*}
                    u^{\ast}_{\text{debt}} 
                &=
                    \frac{
                        \num{1}
                    }{
                        \num{1} + \pct{0.010101} + \pct{0.031201}
                    }
                    \left(
                        \num{1}
                        -
                        \num{0}
                    \right)
                \nonumber \\
                &=
                    \num{0.960370}
            \end{align*}
        And, according to \cref{eqn:fva-debt-financing}, the \FVA/ is therefore:
            \begin{equation*}
                    \FVA/ 
                =
                    \num{0.99} - \num{0.960370}
                =
                    \num{0.029630}
            \end{equation*}
        Any prices above the breakeven price, $u^{\ast}_{\text{debt}}$, 
        will make the project a negative net present value investment for the shareholders, while any prices below will make it positive. 
        
        Consider \cref{fig:marginal-value-debt-financing} showing the marginal value 
        of debt financing for creditors and shareholders for different values of the upfront price.
        The first price to consider is the price that was analysed so far, $\num{0.99}$.
        At this price the entire gain for creditors can be attributed the loss for shareholders.

        Suppose that the counterparty has some additional incentive to sell the derivative,
        such that it quotes a lower price than the theoretical, say $\num{0.97}$.
        Selling the derivative is now a negative net present value investment for the counterparty;
        in other words, the counterparty has made a donation to the firm. 
        The marginal valuation of the project to the shareholders is then $\num{-0.008734}$,
        and to the creditors $\num{0.028734}$.
        The donation from the counterparty has made an increase to the shareholders' 
        \textit{and} to the creditors' marginal valuation relative to the price of $\num{0.99}$.
        Still, for a firm maximising shareholder value, the issue is the same as before;
        the project is a negative net present value investment for the shareholders,
        and therefore it will not be accepted.
        \\
        Clearly, the donation from the counterparty can be distributed between the 
        stakeholders in a non-wealth destructive way. 
        For example, if the legacy creditors were willing to lower the face value of their claim
        to $\num{79.98}$, that would leave a wealth gain for the creditors and shareholders
        of $\num{0.011313}$ and $\num{0.008687}$ respectively.
        This leaves all stakeholders economically happy, 
        except of course from the counterparty who may have other incentives.

        Recall \cref{fig:hw-example} describing the argument of \textcite{HullWhite2012FVA}.
        By their conviction, if a bond with a discount rate of risk-free rate plus $30\basispoint$ 
        traded at an excess yield of $80\basispoint$, it should be traded. 
        This example shows exactly why that does not work in reality.
        At $u=\num{0.97}$, the risk-free project in this example trades at 
        an excess yield of approximately $100\basispoint$.
        Even then, the firm will not be able to get its shareholders on-board.

        From the perspective of a social planner this problem seems to be a no-brainer. 
        However, the operation relies solely on the willingness of creditors to 
        reduce their face value, lower their seniority, or otherwise worsen the terms of their claim.
        In reality, it is very unlikely for the firm to be able to renegotiate 
        the terms of their debt issuance, with multiple creditors all with different incentives.
        \\
        The issue here is a free rider problem. 
        The shareholders pay the funding costs of the new debt in the no-default states,
        but they do not reap the benefits.
        The creditors, on the other hand, pay nothing 
        but still see the value of their claim increase.

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
                \input{\graphicsfolder/marginal-value/debt-financing.pgf}
            }
            \caption{
                Marginal valuation of debt financing 
                assuming that new creditors break even.
            }
            \label{fig:marginal-value-debt-financing}
        \end{figure}

        Another observation from the graph in \cref{fig:marginal-value-debt-financing} is that the donation from the counterparty 
        is distributed between creditors and shareholders.
        As evident from the slope, the shareholders receive a larger share than the creditors.
        \\
        The creditors benefit from the donation since a lower price will
        decrease the face value of the new creditors, and therefore decrease the loss rate
        of the legacy creditors in the default state.
        The decrease of the new creditors' face value reduces the funding costs,
        which benefits the shareholders in the no-default state and increases their wealth.

        This example has shown an apparent friction in the way firms obtain projects.
        Even when the project is heavily discounted the firm is unable to obtain it
        and still preserve its shareholders' wealth.
        It has also shown the problem with the argument of \textcite{HullWhite2012FVA},
        since the firm is not able to distribute the positive net present value
        to the ones financing it.
