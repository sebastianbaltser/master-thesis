    \subsection{Selling Corporate Bonds With Funding Benefits}
    \label{sec:example-funding-benefit}
        In the previous section, 
        the outgoing cash flows, due to the upfront cost of the project,
        demanded funding from the firm, which led to funding costs. 
        The firm would ultimately have to do an \FVA/,
        to account for the funding expenses that obtaining the project would lead to.
        On the contrary, when an instrument has cash flows going into the firm,
        it might have funding implications that are beneficial to the firm.
        Recall, from the introduction of \FVA/, the decomposition of \FVA/ into two elements:
        \begin{equation*}
            \FVA/ = \FCA/ + \FBA/
        \end{equation*}
        In this section, the firm is assumed to sell a single-period corporate bond
        with a face value of $\num{1}$.
        The bond is unsecured, and will now be treated as a new liability to the firm, 
        which ranks pari passu with the already existing debt.

        Since the counterparty buys the bond from the credit-risky firm, 
        the counterparty must account for this exposure. 
        If the firm defaults it will not be able to meet its obligations, 
        and the face value will not be fully paid out. 
        \\
        For the counterparty's incentives to be re-established, 
        the price of the bond needs a valuation adjustment, i.e. $\CVA/_C$. 
        By symmetry, $\CVA/_C = \DVA/_F$, 
        where $\DVA/_F$ is the debit value adjustment made by the firm 
        in order to account for its own risk of default.
        Since the firm can only have positive exposure, $\CVA/_{F}$ equals $0$,
        and the theoretical market price of the bond should therefore be given by:
        \begin{equation}\label{eqn:option-value-credit-risk}
            P = \discountfactor*1 - \CVA/_C = \discountfactor*1 - \DVA/_F
        \end{equation}
        
        Now consider the funding issue. On the transaction date of the bond, 
        the firm receives a premium from the counterparty that can be invested 
        providing a funding benefit. 
        This section will study two possible investments.
        One where the upfront price is used for retiring existing debt 
        that trades at a credit spread over the risk-free rate. 
        Another where the upfront price is used for buying back equity. 

        \subsubsection{Retiring Legacy Debt}
            Suppose that when the firm receives the bond premium at time 0, 
            they immediately invest their surplus of cash by retiring some of their already existing debt.
            
            This section will display how the described procedure will lead to the \DVA/
            accounting for all funding benefits thus eliminating the need for an \FVA/.
            Before seeing this from calculations, it can be argued conceptually
            and the reasons for it can be highlighted.
            \\
            By the assumptions in these examples,
            the only source of the firm's credit spread is the firm's own credit risk, 
            which implies that there is no difference between the CDS spread referencing the firm,
            and the rate that the firm pays for funding.
            The CDS spread determines the cost to the counterparty 
            of hedging its credit exposure to the firm.
            The funding rate determines the benefits to the firm of cash surpluses.
            Therefore there is a strong relation between the two adjustments.
            \\
            Having hinted the possible concerns in the current setup, 
            the example can continue and the issues can be quantified.

            Notice that when the upfront cost is used to purchase debt at a fair market value, 
            a new liability, the bond, is replacing a part of the existing liability, the legacy debt. 
            Remembering the pari passu assumption, this debt-for-debt substitution 
            leaves the total liability unchanged.
            \\
            An outline of the setup is shown in \cref{fig:debt-retiring-setup}
            \begin{figure}[t]
                \centering
                \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
                    \begin{tikzpicture}
                        \import{\graphicsfolder/numerical-examples/}{debt-retiring.tex}
                    \end{tikzpicture}
                }
                \caption{Illustration of debt retiring setup}
                \label{fig:debt-retiring-setup}
            \end{figure}

            The implications of debt buyback are the following.
            First, the net present value for the creditors who tender is zero. 
            Hence, the loss rate as well as the credit spread has to be left unchanged
            after partly retiring the debt, otherwise the creditors would not tender. 
            Second, the counterparty charges for the firm's credit risk 
            to the extent that it is a zero net present value for the counterparty. 
            The cash flow following the bond can be viewed as newly issued debt
            with a fair credit spread offered to the creditors.
            Third, the tendering creditors stay unaffected of the transaction, 
            as the loss rate and credit spread is left intact.
            \\
            Since the bond is a zero net present value for the firm, 
            the counterparty, and the creditors, there is no wealth to transfer anywhere,
            and the contract must also have zero net present value to the shareholders. 
            Hence, the bond fair value must be given by \cref{eqn:option-value-credit-risk} 
            as any other value would influence the wealth of the parties involved.

            Assume now that the firm sells the bond to a counterparty
            for an upfront price of \num{0.96},
            which is spent on retiring debt from the firm's creditors. 
            The bond payable is now a liability to the firm, 
            ranking pari passu with the existing debt.
            Recall that the pre-project face value of the debt is \num{80}.
            \\ 
            The payoffs to the firm's stakeholders after selling the bond 
            are shown in \cref{tbl:example-debt-retiring},
            where the payoff to the counterparty is denoted by $Y_{C}$. 
            The loss rate in the default state remains unchanged 
            and is identical for the creditors and the counterparty
            $\phi(\omega_{5})=1-\num{60}/\num{80}=\pct{0.25}$. 
            Similarly, the credit spread remains the same as the pre-project value
            $\num{79}/\num{75.84}-R=\pct{0.031566}$.
            
            \begin{table}[H]
                \centering
                \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr||r}
                    $i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & Present value \\
                    \hline
                    \rule{0pt}{1.1em}
                    $\tilde{A}(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{120}$ & $\num{110}$ & $\num{100}$ & $\num{95}$ & $\num{60}$ & $\num{96.40}$ \\
                    $D(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{79}$ & $\num{79}$ & $\num{79}$ & $\num{79}$ & $\num{59.25}$ & $\num{75.84}$ \\
                    $E(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{40}$ & $\num{30}$ & $\num{20}$ & $\num{15}$ & $\num{0}$ & $\num{19.60}$ \\
                    $Y_C(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{0.75}$ & $\num{0.96}$ \\

                \label{tbl:example-debt-retiring}
            \end{table}

            The liability side of the firm's balance sheet will then look like:

            \begin{table}[H]
                \centering
                \begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c}
                     & \textbf{Book Value} & \textbf{\DVA/} & \textbf{Market Value} \\
                    \hline
                    Equity & $\num{19.60}$ & $\num{0}$ & $\num{19.60}$\\
                    Debt & $\num{79.20}$ & $\num{3.36}$ & $\num{75.84}$\\
                    Derivative Payable & $\num{0.99}$ & $\num{0.03}$ & $\num{0.96}$\\
                    \hline
                    Total & $\num{99.79}$ & $\num{3.39}$ & $\num{96.40}$
                \end{tabular}
            \end{table}

            The transaction is a zero net present value investment for the shareholders. 
            As can be seen in \cref{tbl:example-debt-retiring}, 
            the shareholders receive a payoff at time 1 equal to the pre-project value.
            The counterparty's payoff coming from the bond, $Y_C$, has a market value of:
            \begin{equation*}
                \pi(Y_{C}) = \discountfactor \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[Y_{C}\right] = \num{0.96}
            \end{equation*}
            This concludes that the bond premium that the firm receives at time 0 is equal to $\num{0.96}$, 
            which is then the amount used for retiring debt. 
            On top of this, the amount can be recognized 
            as the price of the riskless bond adjusted for the firm's credit risk:
            \begin{equation*}
                V = \discountfactor * 1 - \DVA/_F = \num{0.99} - \num{0.03} = \num{0.96}
            \end{equation*}
            which validates \cref{eqn:option-value-credit-risk}. 

            All funding benefits have already been accounted for by the \DVA/;
            therefore, there is no \FVA/ to make.
            \\
            Take the first possible definition of \FVA/, 
            where it was defined as the promised excess funding cost.
            Calculating this quantity yields 
            $\discountfactor u S = \num{0.99} * \num{-0.96} * \pct{0.031566} = \num{-0.03}$,
            which is exactly equal to the \DVA/ with the sign flipped.
            Recall that \textcite{HullWhite2012FVA} use this exact argument to argue against \FVA/s.
            As hinted in the beginning, 
            this is not a coincidence as the CDS spread determining \DVA/
            is identical to the funding rate determining \FVA/.
            Adjusting the \DVA/-adjusted price with the first definition of \FVA/ would be double counting,
            and would lead to the firm undervaluing the bond.
            
            Consider also the last, and chosen, definition of \FVA/,
            where it was defined as the adjustment needed to the shareholders' breakeven.
            As already mentioned, the marginal shareholder value of the bond is zero,
            meaning that the price is already adjusted to the shareholders' breakeven.
            The fact is that the bond in this example needs no \FVA/,
            as the \DVA/ accounts for all funding benefits.
            \\
            Differences between \DVA/ and an adjustment for funding benefits can only occur 
            either because of a mismatch between the CDS spread and the funding spread
            or because of a difference in the portfolio on which the two quantities are calculated. 
            The former has been assumed non-existing.
            The latter could occur if the firm had offsetting trades in its portfolio,
            since the \FVA/ takes into account all sorts of netting benefits.
            In this example there is no offsetting trades, 
            which is why there is no need for an \FVA/, as the \DVA/ have already accounted for everything.

        \subsubsection{Buying Back Equity}
            In this section the firm still sells its corporate bond with a face value of \num{1}.
            Now, the upfront price is used for buying back equity from the shareholders.
            This setup is illustrated in \cref{fig:equity-buyback-setup}.

            In the previous section, selling the bond and retiring debt with the upfront,
            simply corresponded to exchanging some existing debt for some other debt. 
            When buying back equity, the bond value adds to the aggregate liabilities of the firm, 
            and ranks pari passu with the existing creditors.
            This section studies the beneficial impacts on the firm's shareholders of doing this transaction.
            At time 0, the firm allocates some cash to the shareholders;
            therefore, if the firm defaults, the shareholders have already received some payoff.
            This leaves a smaller amount to the creditors compared to their pre-project payoff.

            The firm's balance sheet is left unchanged, meaning that the sum of the market values of debt, equity, 
            and bond payable is the same after the transaction. 
            The values of the different parties are shown in \cref{tbl:example-equity-buyback}. 
            The loss rate increases from the pre-project value and is computed as:
            $\phi = 1 - \num{60}/\num{81} = \pct{0.25925926}$.
            Similarly, the credit spread increases to
            $\num{80}/\num{76.711111} - \grossrfrate = \pct{0.032772686}$.
            \begin{table}[H]
                \centering
                \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr||r}
                    $i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & Present value \\
                    \hline
                    \rule{0pt}{1.1em}
                    $\tilde{A}(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{120}$ & $\num{110}$ & $\num{100}$ & $\num{95}$ & $\num{60}$ & $\num{96.4}$ \\
                    $D(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{80}$ & $\num{80}$ & $\num{80}$ & $\num{80}$ & $\num{59.259259}$ & $\num{76.711111}$ \\
                    $E(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{39}$ & $\num{29}$ & $\num{19}$ & $\num{14}$ & $\num{0}$ & $\num{18.73}$ \\
                    $Y_C(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{1}$ & $\num{0.74074074}$ & $\num{0.95888889}$ \\
                \end{tabular}
                \caption{}
                \label{tbl:example-equity-buyback}
            \end{table}

            The project is again assumed to be a zero net present value investment for the counterparty.
            In other words,
            the firm receives an upfront of the credit risk adjusted market value,
            i.e. $u=\num{-0.95888889}$, as the bond premium at time 0, which is immediately spend on equity buyback.

            Buying back equity leaves two payoffs for the shareholders:
            (i) the immediate payoff corresponding to the bond premium, and
            (ii) the present value of the expected payoff at time 1.
            \\
            To establish whether entering into this project is attractive for the shareholders,
            the expression for the marginal valuation of equity funding, \cref{eqn:marginal-shareholder-value-equity-financing}, is used.
            The payoff for the firm is here the negative bond payoff, i.e. $Y$.
            The survival probability is $p^{\rnmeasure} = \pct{0.878788}$, 
            and the covariance between the indicator of default states and $Y$ is 0 
            as the promised payoff is known with certainty.
            The change of wealth for the shareholders is then calculated as:
            \begin{equation*}
                G_{\text{equity}} = \num{0.088888889}
            \end{equation*}
            
            Again, as the price of the bond is assumed to be the credit risk adjusted market value,
            the bond is a zero net present value for the counterparty.
            The positive marginal valuation for the shareholders then implies a wealth transfer from the creditors to the shareholders.
            Hence, the bond contract is a positive net present value investment for the shareholders, 
            where the change of wealth is verified by the change in the present value of the expected payoff:
            \begin{equation*}
                (\num{18.73} + \num{0.95888889}) - \num{19.6} = \num{0.088888889}
            \end{equation*}
            On the other hand, the transaction is a negative net present value investment for the creditors:
            \begin{equation*}
                \num{76.711111} - \num{76.8} = \num{-0.088888889}
            \end{equation*}
            Notice that, even though the price received on the bond is lower than in the previous section,
            the shareholders see an increase in their wealth.
            In the last section, the price was \num{0.96} and the shareholders broke even.
            In this example, the upfront payment is lower, 
            but the shareholders' marginal valuation is positive.
            This confirms the pecking order theory for $u<0$;
            shareholders prefer equity buybacks over debt retiring.
            \begin{figure}[t]
                \centering
                \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
                    \begin{tikzpicture}
                        \import{\graphicsfolder/numerical-examples/}{equity-buyback.tex}
                    \end{tikzpicture}
                }
                \caption{Illustration of equity buyback setup}
                \label{fig:equity-buyback-setup}
            \end{figure}

            The positive marginal valuation of the shareholders does suggest,
            that they are willing to accept an even lower price than \num{0.95888889}.
            The lowest price the shareholders will accept, is the breakeven price,
            which, under equity financing, can be computed from 
            \cref{eqn:shareholders-breakeven-equity-financing}:
            \begin{equation*}
                u_{\text{equity}}^{\ast} =
                - \discountfactor
                \pct{0.878788}
                = \num{-0.87}
            \end{equation*}
            which suggest an \FVA/ given by:
            \begin{equation*}
                \FVA/ =
                u_{\text{equity}}^{\ast} - u =
                \num{-0.87} - \left(\num{-0.95888889}\right) =
                \num{0.088888889}
            \end{equation*}
            The positive valuation adjustment suggests an overall funding benefit.
            
            Similar to the case of buying the bond by issuing new shares analysed in \cref{sec:example-equity-issuance},
            the \FVA/ amount is equal to the wealth transfer.
            Evidently, the price cut from the firm is translated directly to a wealth loss
            for the shareholders while the creditors wealth is maintained. 
            The donation from the firm to the counterparty does not affect the total asset value;
            therefore, the loss rate on the debt and the bond payable remains unchanged,
            and so does the present value of the creditors' and counterparty's payoffs.
            \\
            The creditors still lose wealth worth \num{0.088888889} from the firm obtaining the project.
            The shareholders are however willing to receive a lower price of the project than $\num{0.95888889}$.
            For all prices down to $\num{0.87}$,
            the shareholders will still consider the transaction a non-negative net present value investment.

            In conclusion, when financing with equity issuance or buybacks,
            the price of the project is irrelevant to the creditors,
            as price adjustments are transferred directly to shareholders.
            The wealth of the creditors is solely dependent on the payoff structure of the project;
            their wealth increases when the asset value increases and vice versa.

        \subsection{No Funding Buyback}
            Now suppose, instead of buying back debt or equity, 
            the firm spends the cash proceeds from the upfront price in riskless assets. 
            If the derivative traded with the counterparty has a known payoff at time 1, this procedure is virtually the same as if the firm borrows money to buy the risk-free asset 
            as described in \cref{sec:example-risk-free-project-debt-issuance}. 
            To deviate from the exact same conclusions, the derivative is now assumed to have a payoff structure at time 1 
            as described in \cref{tbl:risky-option-payoff}. 
            The derivative will still be fairly priced, i.e. the price is the discounted expected payoff for the counterparty, 
            such that the credit risk of the firm is accounted for in the price. 
            At time 1 the firm will pay the counterparty accordingly, hence the derivative payable, 
            is a contingent liability to the firm and ranks pari passu with the already existing debt.
            \\
            This section analyses whether this capital structure setup causes reasons for funding benefits.
            Intuitively, this could seem appropriate as the firm receives cash proceeds from the upfront price that can be invested beneficially.
            
            \begin{table}[H]
                \centering
                \begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr}

                    $Y(\omega_{i})$ & $\num{-4}$ & $\num{-3.5}$ & $\num{-2.5}$ & $\num{-1.5}$ & $\num{-1}$ \\

                \caption{}

            \end{table}

            After receiving the upfront price in the form of cash, the firm immediately invests in the risk-free asset. 
            This implies that the firm's total asset value increases 
            with an amount equal to the forward discounted upfront price. 
            The capital structure, after this transaction, is described in \cref{tbl:example-no-funding-buyback}.
            The derivative's credit risk adjusted price and loss rate given default are found
            by solving the following system of equations for $\pi(Y_C)$ and $\phi(\omega_{5})$:
            \begin{align}
                \left\{\begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
                    \displaystyle
                    \pi(Y_C) = \discountfactor\mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[Y_{C}\right]
                    \\[1em]
                    \displaystyle
                    A(\omega_5) + uR = D(\omega_5) + Y_C(\omega_5)
                    \\[0.4em]
                \end{array}\right.
                \label{eqn:no-funding-buyback-default-state}
            \end{align}
            with the second equation ensuring that the 
            sum of the payoffs to the creditors and the counterparty
            equals the asset value in case of default, i.e. state $\omega_5$.
            The realized asset value at maturity here includes the value of the derivative adding to the total asset base.

            The loss rate given default obtained from solving the above problem is 
            $\phi(\omega_{5}) = \pct{0.230361}$, 
            and the new credit spread is then 
            $\num{80}/\num{76.988534} - \grossrfrate = \pct{0.0290148}$.
            Compare the new credit spread with the pre-project credit spread of \pct{0.031566};
            by obtaining the new project, the credit spread has decreased quite significantly.
            The reduction can be explained by the project's payoff structure,
            as the states where the firm's asset value is the highest are
            also the states where the project's payoff is the highest and vice versa. 
            Therefore, by selling the project, the firm has reduced its riskiness
            as well as the loss rate and credit spread of the creditors.

                \caption{}

            The market value of the derivative including adjustments for credit risk would deem a fair price of the project,
            as it would be a zero net present value investment for the counterparty.
            With such pricing, however, a transfer of wealth will occur between the shareholders and the creditors.

            Selling a derivative and using the sale proceeds for buying the risk-free asset,
            is equivalent, but with opposite signs,
            to buying a derivative and funding the upfront price with existing cash.
            In the latter case, the existing cash could have earned the risk-free rate
            and it has an opportunity cost;
            in the former case, the sale proceeds actually earn the risk-free rate.
            This is taken care of by \cref{eqn:marginal-shareholder-value-cash-financing},
            which defines the marginal change in the shareholders' wealth using existing cash financing.
            \\
            The marginal change in the equity valuation with $u=\num{-2.3173567}$ is therefore:
            \begin{equation*}
                G_{\text{cash}} = p^{\rnmeasure}\pi
                -\discountfactor \text{Cov}^{\rnmeasure}\left(\mathbbm{1}_{\mathcal{D}},Y\right) = \num{-0.188534}
            \end{equation*}

            The change in wealth for the shareholders can be verified by the difference between the new present value of the equity and the old present value of the equity:
            \begin{equation*}
                \num{19.411469} - \num{19.6} = \num{-0.188531}
            \end{equation*}
            The change in wealth for the creditors is similarly verified by:
            \begin{equation*}
                \num{76.988534} - \num{76.8} = \num{0.188534}
            \end{equation*}
            
            The increment happens as the risk-free asset, which the firm invested in with the upfront price, 
            makes the asset value increase, and a larger total amount is recovered in case of default. 
            If the firm does not default, the creditors are not affected by the new project.
            Hence, this is a negative net present value for the shareholders 
            and a positive net present value for the creditors.
            \\
            Due to the risk in the derivative, the shareholders do have a chance to gain from the project, 
            where in state $\omega_4$, the derivative payable is less than the return on the risk-free asset.

            On the basis of the wealth transfer there seems to be some funding implications.
            The \FVA/ is, as always, the adjustment to the project's apparent value to the firm that makes the shareholders indifferent to taking on the project.
            As the firm is funding the risk-free project with the premium proceeds, no funding benefits actually occur, and the \FVA/ is constituted entirely by the funding costs from paying the derivative payable.

            Using \cref{eqn:shareholdes-breakeven-cash-financing}, which describes the shareholders' price of breakeven with cash financing:
            \begin{equation*}
                u_{\text{cash}}^{\ast} = \discountfactor \left(
                    \mathbb{E}^{\rnmeasure}\left[Y\right] -
                    \frac{\text{Cov}^{\rnmeasure}\left(\mathbbm{1}_{\mathcal{D}},Y\right)}
                    {p^{\rnmeasure}}
                \right)
                = \num{2.5318966}
            \end{equation*}
            yielding a valuation adjustment of:
            \begin{equation*}
                \FVA/ = u_{\text{cash}}^{\ast} - u = \num{2.5318966} - \num{2.3173567} = \num{0.2145446}
            \end{equation*}

            Alternatively, this value can be computed by solving the related equation system for \FCA/ as described above, where the value to the firm is the funding cost adjusted market value:
            \begin{align*}
                \left\{\begin{array}{@{}l@{}}
                    \displaystyle
                    V = \pi(Y_C) + \FVA/
                    \\[0.5em]
                    \displaystyle
                    A(\omega_5) + uR = D(\omega_5) + Y_C(\omega_5)
                    \\[0.5em]
                    G_{\text{cash}} = 0
                \end{array}\right.
            \end{align*}
            The first equation is the adjusted derivative value to the firm.
            This will replaces the fair market value pricing assumption, 
            the second equation in \cref{eqn:no-funding-buyback-default-state}, in the new setup.
            Furthermore, the third equation ensures that there is no wealth transfer from the shareholders.
            The new problem solved yields a loss rate of $\phi = \pct{0.22768554}$,
            which is slightly lower,
            and the donation needed from the counterparty to make the project a zero net present value for the shareholders is $\FVA/ = \num{0.2145446}$.

            As this example have shown, selling a derivative is not a sure-fire way
            to gain funding benefits.
            The investment that the firm makes with the upfront price has a huge impact 
            on the shareholders' valuation, in accordance with the pecking order theory
            in \cref{eqn:pecking-order-of-financing-preferences}.
            Investing in the risk-free asset is the least favourable investment the firm can make.
            The payoff structure of this specific derivative is clearly also a great driver,
            in the direction of the shareholders' welfare loss. 
            \\
            Using a structural model analogy;
            since the shareholders' claim can be modelled as a European call option,
            they would like for the riskiness of the underlying to increase
            due to the positiveness of the option Vega.
            Since the derivative in question reduces the riskiness of the firm's total assets,
            so does the value of the shareholders' claim.
