    Having derived a framework in which funding costs are defined, 
    the paper can move on to applying the results in a practical application.
    The current section will consider the implications of funding costs and funding value adjustments,
    for a derivatives dealer operating in a single-period economy.
    As evident from the previous theoretical derivations, 
    obtaining projects might influence the value of the shareholders' and the creditors' claims.

    Before considering any projects, 
    the following section defines the capital structure of the firm in question,
    and introduces a derivatives dealer taking the firm's investment decisions.
