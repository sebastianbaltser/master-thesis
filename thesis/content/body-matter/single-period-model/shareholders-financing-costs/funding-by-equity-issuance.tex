    \subsubsection{Funding by equity issuance}
        In addition to obtaining debt, new projects can be financed by issuing additional shares
        that will be a source of equity capital.
        Share issuances dilutes the firm's stocks, which can reduce the value of the existing shareholders' stocks,
        which will be the source of the conflict of interest with this type of funding.
        It is assumed that the market for newly issued equity is sufficiently competitive,
        such that new shareholders break even when purchasing the newly issued shares;
        in other words, buying the firm's newly issued stock is a zero net present value investment.
