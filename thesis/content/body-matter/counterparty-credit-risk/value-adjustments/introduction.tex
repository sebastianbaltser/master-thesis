    Following the 2008 financial crisis,
    financial institutions have increased their focus on 
    adjustments to the risk-neutral price of derivatives;
    adjustments collectively known as X Value Adjustments (XVA).
    This section will introduce a few of these, 
    namely Credit-, Debit-, and Funding Value Adjustments,
    since the former two will be of necessity to the exploration of the latter.

    Deliberately free of mathematical details this section will be of introductory nature 
    and lay ground for more in-depth discussions, 
    when a framework allowing technical developments has been established.
