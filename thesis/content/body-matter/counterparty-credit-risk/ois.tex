    \section{Overnight Index Swap Rates}
    
    An index swap is a contract that exchanges a fixed cash flow, determined at inception,
    for a floating cash flow tied to some price index.
    As implied by the name, an Overnight Index Swap, \OIS/, is a special case of an index swap
    that uses an overnight rate index to calculate the floating leg.
    The floating payments of an \OIS/ are the daily compounded overnight rate 
    over the floating coupon period,
    while the fixed rate is a rate referred to as the \OIS/ rate.
    The price index that specifies the reference rate is typically the overnight 
    lending rate between banks published by the central bank, e.g. the Federal Funds Rate.
    At maturity of the \OIS/, the parties exchange the difference between the interest accrued 
    at the fixed rate and the interest accrued at the compounded floating index rate.
    There is no exchange of principal; 
    therefore, an \OIS/ generally carries very little credit risk. 
    Conceptually, the \OIS/ rate can be thought of as representing a given country's
    central bank rate throughout a period set by the \OIS/' term. 

    The \OIS/ rate can be combined with the LIBOR to form an indicative measure
    known as the LIBOR-\OIS/ spread.

    \subsection{The LIBOR-\OIS/ spread}

    The London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR, represents the average rate 
    at which major London based banks charge each other for short-term unsecured borrowing.
    Multiple other reference rates for the interbank market exists, 
    such as Euribor for Eurozone banks and TIBOR for Tokyo based banks.
    Some results in the following are not particularly dependent on the specific rate.
    When that is the case, the generic term xIBOR will be used 
    to refer to these interest rate benchmarks.

    A common measure of the banking system's health is the difference between the \OIS/ rate
    and the LIBOR, known as the LIBOR-\OIS/ spread.
    This spread can be used as an indication of how banks perceive the creditworthiness
    of other financial institutions. 
    The LIBOR-\OIS/ spread is a better indicator of credit risk in the interbank lending market
    than the LIBOR itself. 
    The LIBOR is influenced both by the rates set by central banks and 
    the general credit risk in the interbank lending market,
    while the \OIS/ rate is only based on the rates set by central banks.
    Therefore, subtracting the \OIS/ rate from LIBOR should isolate the credit premium.
    A higher spread can be interpreted as a lower willingness to lend by major banks
    and therefore lower liquidity in the money market.

    \subsection{\OIS/ as the risk-free rate}
    
    Before the financial crisis in 2007, banks have typically been discounting
    derivatives using interest rate curves based on the various interbank borrowing rates.
    Typically, the interest rate curves were based on 3-Month xIBOR.
    \textcite[Section 8.6]{Green2015XVA} 
    mentions two possible reasons for banks using these indices.
    First, the xIBOR discount curves were considered, and used, as proxies for the risk-free rate
    as, pre-crisis, the underlying banks in xIBOR generally had high credit ratings
    and were regarded as very safe counterparties.
    xIBOR rates were in fact very close to the yields of bonds issued by highly rated governments,
    and the xIBOR rates could be considered as being very close to risk-free 
    while being associated with highly liquid market.
    Second, the xIBOR curves represented the banks' own funding rate for derivatives, since
    xIBOR referenced unsecured borrowing rates.

            The spread is usually relatively low, 
            but blows up during recessions, 
            such as the financial crisis in 2007 to 2009 or
            the Covid-19 crisis in March 2020.

        }
        \label{fig:ted-spread}
    \end{figure}

    In the beginning of the financial crisis, the xIBORs rose significantly
    which widened spreads such as LIBOR-\OIS/ or LIBOR against the T-bill.
    The latter spread is shown in \cref{fig:ted-spread}. This clearly 
    displays how the LIBOR against a very safe government bond blows up
    during recessions in the economy. 
    While not directly comparing LIBOR and \OIS/, 
    the TED spread conveys the conclusion very well nonetheless;
    the xIBOR contains other premiums than simply the risk-free rate.
    This conclusion supports the conclusion from the previous section,
    that spreads such as LIBOR-\OIS/, isolate the credit premium.
    Therefore, their widening implies that the perceived credit risk of the banks in LIBOR increased.

    The ballooning of these spreads
    had significant influence on the banks' pricing and valuation of derivatives
    as the previously mentioned arguments for xIBOR-discounting were disproven.
    The market was to find another curve to use for the risk-free rate,
    and, according to \textcite{Green2015XVA}, the choice have generally been the \OIS/.

    In this paper \OIS/ will be used as the risk-free rate.
    As the precise values of the interest rates are not too important for this paper,
    neither is the choice of risk-free rate.
    Still, it will be easier conceptually to have decided on one,
    so the following paragraph presents arguments for using the \OIS/.

    There are two sources of credit risk in an \OIS/.
    The first is the credit risk in the overnight borrowing of federal funds, which is very small. 
    The second is the risk of one of the swap counterparties defaulting.
    \textcite{HullWhiteOISvsLIBOR}
    argue that this second risk is negligible in collateralized transactions,
    which standard swaps like \OIS/ are due to legislation.
    Since credit risk is of inconsiderable size, it can be concluded 
    that the \OIS/ rate is a good proxy for the risk-free rate.
    Per these arguments, this paper will refer to the \OIS/ rate as the risk-free rate
    and vice versa, depending on the context.
    As a consequence of this, the \OIS/ rate will also be the rate earned on collateral postings.

    When the unsecured borrowing rates, such as LIBOR, exploded during the financial crisis, 
    so did the funding costs. 
    Suddenly, the unsecured funding costs went from negligible to significant,
    which prompted financial institutions to account for them, 
    with so called \textit{funding value adjustments}. 
    This type of valuation adjustment, among others, is the topic of the following section.
