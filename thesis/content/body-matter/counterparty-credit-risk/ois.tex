    \subsection{Overnight Index Swap Rates}
    
    \subsubsection{The LIBOR-\OIS/ spread}
    An index swap is a contract that exchanges a fixed cash flow, determined at inception,
    for a floating cash flow tied to some price index.
    As implied by the name, an Overnight Index Swap, \OIS/, is a special case of an index swap
    that uses an overnight rate index to calculate the floating leg.
    The floating payments of an \OIS/ is the daily compounded overnight rate 
    over the floating coupon period,
    while the fixed rate is a rate referred to as the \OIS/ rate.
    The price index that specifies the reference rate is typically the overnight 
    lending rate between banks published by the central bank, e.g. the Federal Funds Rate.
    At maturity of the \OIS/, the parties exchange the difference between the interest accrued 
    at the fixed rate and the interest accrued at the compounded floating index rate.
    There is no exchange of principal; 
    therefore, an \OIS/ generally carries very little credit risk. 
    Conceptually, the \OIS/ rate can be thought of as representing a given country's
    central bank rate throughout a period set by the \OIS/' term. 

    The London Interbank Offered Rate, LIBOR, represents the average rate 
    at which major London based banks charge each other for short-term unsecured borrowing.
    Multiple other reference rates for the interbank market exists, 
    such as Euribor for Eurozone banks and TIBOR for Tokyo based banks.
    Some results in the following are not particularly dependent on the specific rate.
    When that is the case, the generic term xIBOR will be used 
    to refer to these interest rate benchmarks.

    A common measure of the banking system's health is the difference between the \OIS/ rate
    and the LIBOR, known as the LIBOR-\OIS/ spread.
    This spread can be used as an indication of how bank's perceive the creditworthiness
    of other financial institutions. 
    The LIBOR-\OIS/ spread should be a better indicator 
    of credit risk in the interbank lending market than the LIBOR itself,
    since the LIBOR is influenced both by the rates set by central banks and 
    the general credit risk in the interbank lending market,
    while the \OIS/ rate is only based on the rates set by central banks.
    Therefore, subtracting the \OIS/ rate from LIBOR should isolate the credit premium.
    A higher spread could be interpreted as a low willingness to lend by major banks
    and therefore low liquidity in the money market.

    \subsubsection{\OIS/ as the risk-free rate}
    
    Before the financial crisis in 2007, banks have typically been discounting
    derivatives using interest rate curves based on the various interbank borrowing rates.
    Typically, the interest rate curves were based on 3-Month xIBOR.
    \textcite[Section 8.6]{Green2015XVA} 
    mentions two possible reasons for banks using these indices.
    First, the xIBOR discount curves was considered and used as proxies for the risk-free rate;
    Pre-crisis the underlying banks in xIBOR generally had high credit ratings
    and were regarded as very safe counterparties.
    xIBOR rates were in fact very close to the yields of bonds issued by highly rated governments,
    and the xIBOR rates could be considered as being very close to risk-free 
    while being associated with highly liquid market.
    Second, the xIBOR curves represented the banks' own funding rate for derivatives, since
    xIBOR referenced unsecured borrowing rates.

            The spread is usually relatively low, 
            but blows out during recessions, 
            such as the financial crisis in 2007 to 2009 or
            the Covid-19 crisis in March 2020.

        \label{fig:ted-spread}
    \end{figure}

    In the beginning of the financial crisis, the xIBORs rose significantly
    which widened spreads such as LIBOR-\OIS/ or LIBOR against the T-bill.
    The latter spread is shown in \cref{fig:ted-spread} which clearly 
    displays how the LIBOR against a very safe government bond blows out of proportions
    during recessions in the economy. 
    While not directly comparing LIBOR and \OIS/, 
    the TED spread conveys the conclusion very well nonetheless;
    the xIBOR contains other premiums than simply the risk-free rate.

    When the aforementioned spreads widened, 
    it had significant influence on the banks' pricing and valuation of derivatives.
    The arguments for xIBOR discounting previously mentioned
    were disproven as the spreads ballooned.
    The market was to find another curve to use for the risk-free rate.
    In this paper \OIS/ will be used as the risk-free rate;
    the following paragraph presents arguments for that decision.

    There are two sources of credit risk in an \OIS/.
    The first is the credit risk in the overnight borrowing of federal funds, which is very small. 
    The second is the risk of one of the swap counterparties defaulting.
    \textcite{HullWhiteOISvsLIBOR}
    argue that this second risk is negligible in collateralized transactions,
    which standard swaps like \OIS/ are due to legislation.
    Since credit risk is of inconsiderable size it can be concluded 
    that the \OIS/ rate is a good proxy for the risk-free rate.
