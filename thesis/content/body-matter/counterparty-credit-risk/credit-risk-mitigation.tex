    \subsection{Credit risk mitigation}
    
    Credit risk mitigation is actions taken by firms with the purpose of reducing their own credit risk,
    by protecting against the negative impact of a counterparty defaulting.
    This section will discuss two methods of mitigating credit risk,
    namely collateralization and trading through a central clearing house.

    \subsubsection{Collateralization}
        Credit risk can be reduced significantly and even eliminated completely
        if the counterparty provides some form of security, which the firm has priority to.
        Should the counterparty default, the firm can use the security to cover any
        outstanding liabilities of the counterparty to the firm. 
        The type of security used and the circumstances 
        under which they are available to the other entity can vary significantly.
        This section will describe two common ways of providing security, 
        namely \textit{repo transactions} and \textit{CSA agreements}.

        A repurchase agreement, or a repo, is a trade in which a firm sells securities to another firm, 
        referred to as the lender, 
        with the promise of buying back the securities at a fixed price on a fixed date.
        The firm receives cash from the lender and the lender receives the securities,
        which it uses as security for the money lent to the firm. 
        If the firm defaults and fails to honour its obligation to buy back the security,
        the lender can keep the security and possibly liquidate it to recover the cash lent. 
        Repos can be used as a form of short-term borrowing for the seller
        and an opportunity for the lender to invest funds for a customized period of time. 
        Traders can use repos to apply leverage by buying long positions in securities 
        which they then post as the collateral in the repo. 

        Derivative transactions can be secured in a similar way 
        if the counterparties agree upon and adhere to a Credit Support Annex, CSA, agreement.
        A CSA defines terms and conditions that allows the posting of collateral between counterparties, 
        in order to secure a transaction made between them.
        Most CSA agreements require both entities in the transaction to post collateral 
        if they have negative exposure to their counterparty. 
        This is important for derivatives transactions that can have both 
        positive and negative mark-to-market values, 
        such that an entity can be both positively and negatively exposed to the counterparty
        during the lifetime of the transaction.
        When collateral is posted, the counterparty can of course use it to cover losses incurred 
        due to the default of the other party;
        however, an important feature of CSA agreements is the ability of firms to
        \textit{rehypothecate} collateral.
        For a firm to rehypothecate collateral is to reuse it by passing it on to other parties that 
        requires collateral from the firm.
        By doing this, the firm can reduce, or even eliminate, the need for providing its own funds
        for supporting other CSA agreements. 
        This mechanism will prove to be very important in the context of funding value adjustments,
        which will be introduced later in this paper.

        If collateral should be posted, and how much should be posted, 
        depends on a number of parameters defined in the CSA agreement
        as well as external values due to the general market conditions.
        The parameters deemed most important will be described in the following:
        \begin{description}
            \item[Threshold] 
            The threshold is the level of positive or negative exposure 
            above which collateral will be posted. 
            A higher threshold for the counterparty will also yield a higher exposure to the counterparty,
            however only to the extent of the threshold size. 
            Typically, CSA agreements between banks will have zero thresholds, 
            such that derivative transaction is fully collateralized.
            
            \item[Minimum transfer amount] 
            The minimum transfer amount represents how much positive or negative exposure
            the two firms can have before collateral is posted;
            hence, it is the smallest amount of collateral that can be exchanged between counterparties.
            It is often used to avoid the operational overhead from posting collateral for negligible amounts,
            but, like the exposure threshold, it comes at the cost of increased exposure.

            This parameter is also a threshold and the difference between this
            and the actual threshold-parameter might be subtle.
            The threshold refers to the exposure directly due to the mark-to-market value,
            however the minimum transfer amount considers the exposure after taking into 
            account the mark-to-market, the current collateral posted, and the threshold.

            \item[Independent amount]
            An independent amount is an amount of collateral posted regardless of the mark-to-market 
            of the derivative, with the purpose of accounting for potential under-collateralization.
            A party posting an independent amount decreases the exposure for the other party
            since it works as an initial buffer for credit risk mitigation.

            \item[Collateral call frequency]
            The collateral call frequency specifies how often a party can submit calls for collateral.
            Typically, CSA agreements between banks will have daily call frequency;
            other organizations will have a lower frequency simply due to the operational burden
            of posting collateral as often as daily. 
            A lower call frequency means larger exposure to the counterparty,
            as the mark-to-market will have longer to diverge from the collateral posted 
            at the last valuation date.
        \end{description}

        Besides the parameters mention, CSA agreements will have specifications of the type of collateral allowed,
        i.e. which currencies can be posted or if government bonds can be used as collateral,
        as well as a procedure to follow if one of the parties is downgraded to a specified credit rating.
        It should be emphasized that the parameters might not be identical for each party,
        if one party has a different credit quality than the other.
        If the credit qualities differ a lot, the CSA agreement might even be one-directional,
        such that only one party posts collateral.

        For the purpose of benchmarking collateralization schemes, 
        it will be helpful to define the theoretical concept of a \textit{perfect} CSA agreement.
        A perfect CSA will have zero threshold and zero minimum transfer amount.
        In addition, it will have a, so to speak, infinitely high collateral call frequency,
        meaning that collateral calls are made continuously and instantly 
        whenever there is the slightest change in the mark-to-market value. 
        If the counterparty instantly meets collateral calls and have no cure period,
        a perfect CSA agreement would eliminate the exposure to the counterparty
        and therefore the credit risk.
        Of course, this is merely a theoretical construct, as all sorts of frictions introduces delays,
        which would break the assumptions.
        Nonetheless, the idea of a perfect CSA will be helpful to have as a reference,
        when introducing funding value adjustments.

        As a final remark on this topic,
        it is important to note that this thesis will have a rather idealized perception of collateralization.
        It is assumed that each collateral payment perfectly offsets the mark-to-market value,
        which is not necessarily the case in the real world,
        where there might be disputes over the value of different instruments.
        In addition, it is assumed that calls for collateral will instantly be answered
        by either the required collateral or the counterparty's default. 
        In reality, collateral will not arrive instantly and there will most likely be a period of time between
        the point where the counterparty does not post collateral to the point where it actually defaults.
        All of these frictions of the real world increase the credit risk to the counterparty
        and must be considered in practical applications. 
        In the context of funding value adjustments, 
        they would simply be part of a large pool of contributors to funding frictions,
        and there is no value lost in assuming them non-existing;
        however, a great amount of simplicity is gained.
