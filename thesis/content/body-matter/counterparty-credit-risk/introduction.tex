    An integral component of the topics discussed in this paper is the tendency of firms to default.
    In any transaction that leaves a firm exposed to the counterparty,
    there is a risk that the counterparty does not honour its obligations to repay its debt.
    This risk, that the counterparty fails to make payments and defaults, 
    is referred to as the counterparty credit risk or simply the credit risk.
    Many of the issues with which this paper is concerned exists because of credit risk 
    and this section will therefore introduce its implications as well as possible mitigations.

    The first subject of this section will be concerned with credit risk mitigations,
    which intend to reduce the counterparty credit risk exposure.
